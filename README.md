# Open Source, 3D Printable, Modular Bipedal Robot Project

The **Modular Bipedal Robot** project aims to educate and inspire individuals interested in robotics and electronics. This open-source initiative focuses on creating a fully autonomous companion robot with a variety of advanced features.

## Key Features

- **Bipedal Design**: The robot includes articulated legs for bipedal movement.
- **Control Systems**: Utilizes Arduino and Raspberry Pi, managed through custom PCBs.
- **Modular Body**: Configurable body components allow for easy customization and adaptability.
- **Software Modules**:
  - Animation: Handles the animation of the robot, including walking, turning, and other movements.
  - Braillespeak: Converts text to Braille and speaks it using a proprietary audio output using the onboard buzzer.
  - Buzzer: Controls the buzzer for audio output. Includes the ability to play tones and melodies.
  - ChatGPT: Uses the OpenAI GPT models to process text based on user input.
  - Logging: Logs data to a file for debugging and analysis.
  - Motion Detection: Handles motion detection using an onboard microwave motion sensor.
  - Neopixel: Controls the onboard Neopixel LEDs for visual feedback.
  - PiServo: Controls the servos connected to the Raspberry Pi.
  - PiTemperature: Reads the temperature from the integrated temperature sensor on the Raspberry Pi.
  - RTLSDR: Uses an RTL-SDR dongle to receive and process radio signals.
  - Serial Connection: Handles serial communication between the Raspberry Pi and Arduino.
  - Servos: Controls the servos connected to the Arduino via the Raspberry Pi and the serial connection.
  - Tracking: Uses computer vision to track objects and faces using the onboard camera.
  - Translator: Translates text between languages using the Google Translate API.
  - TTS: Converts text to speech using the onboard speaker.
  - Viam: Uses the VIAM API to integrate Viam modules for additional functionality.
  - Vision: Handles image processing and computer vision tasks using the onboard IMX500 Raspberry Pi AI camera.
